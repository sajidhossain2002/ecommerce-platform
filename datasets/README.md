# E-Commerce Platform - Dataset Documentation

This folder contains eleven CSV files that seed the e-commerce database with realistic sample data. Each file matches the column order defined in `sql/schema.sql` and can be imported via `sql/load_data.sql`.

| File | Rows | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `categories.csv` | 15 | Multi-level taxonomy (Electronics, Fashion, Home, etc.) with parent relationships. |
| `products.csv` | 30 | Realistic SKUs with brand, pricing, inventory, and merchandising flags. |
| `product_images.csv` | 44 | Image URLs and metadata for each product. |
| `customers.csv` | 20 | Boston-area customers with contact info, loyalty balances, and lifecycle metadata. |
| `shipping_addresses.csv` | 25 | Home/work addresses tied to customers with default flags. |
| `cart_items.csv` | 11 | Active shopping carts that illustrate abandonment and in-progress orders. |
| `orders.csv` | 40 | Order headers covering processing, shipped, delivered, and refunded flows. |
| `order_items.csv` | 48 | Line items per order with quantity breakpoints and discounts. |
| `payment_transactions.csv` | 40 | Stripe and PayPal transactions with settlement states. |
| `reviews.csv` | 50 | Verified purchase reviews with ratings, helpful counts, and timestamps. |
| `audit_log.csv` | 16 | Representative audit entries generated by trigger functions. |

## Data Highlights
- Pricing, tax, and shipping values mirror Massachusetts market conditions (8% state tax, tiered shipping fees).
- Product catalog references recognizable brands (Apple, Sony, Nike, Dyson) with accurate price points recorded in October 2024.
- Customer journeys progress logically: registration predates orders, orders precede reviews, and refunds adjust loyalty balances.
- Review text blends positive, mixed, and constructive feedback to support sentiment analysis experiments.
- Addresses map to Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, and surrounding neighborhoods with valid ZIP codes.

## Import Checklist
1. Run `sql/load_data.sql` from the repository root so `\COPY` can resolve relative paths.
2. Keep triggers disabled during the initial import (see README instructions) to avoid recalculating inventory or loyalty metrics.
3. After the load completes, verify row counts with the summary query bundle at the end of `sql/load_data.sql`.

## Quality Assurance
- Foreign key relationships validated by the load script; orphaned rows trigger an error count of zero.
- Monetary columns use two decimal places and align with derived totals in views and analytics queries.
- Timestamp columns follow ISO 8601 and are set in Eastern Time; adjust to UTC as needed for production.
- Plain ASCII text ensures compatibility with cross-platform tooling.
